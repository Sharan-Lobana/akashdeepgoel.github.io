      <h1>Who is a Geek ?</h1>
      <p class="lead"><b>" </b>Geeks like us are allowed to be unironically enthusiastic about stuff. We don't have to be like, 'Oh yeah that purse is okay' or like, 'Yeah, I like that band's early stuff.' Geeks are allowed to love stuff, like jump-up-and-down-in-the-air-can't-control-yourself love it. When people call people geeks mostly what they are saying is, 'You like stuff,' which is just not a good insult at all, like 'You are too enthusiastic about the miracle of human consciousness.'<b> "</b><br>

          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>Have you ever had a giddy feeling when someone mentioned your favorite book? 'Butterflies in my stomach' is just an iota of what you experience if you hear somebody quote a line from your favorite movie or TV series? Are you over-the-top-I'm-going-to-scream! enthusiastic about something which others just don't understand? If answer to any of the above is a yes, feel free to jump into the 'Geek' boat.</p>
          <p> Ever since the dawn of humanity there has always been a group of individuals who have been fanatic about something which interests them. Our inner-self throbs with zeal and it sometimes is a driving force in our lives. Now we have a word for it, a 'geek'. Wikipedia defines a geek as 'an expert or enthusiast or a person obsessed with a hobby or intellectual pursuit'. We devour knowledge concerning the topic we are crazy about, which can be anything ranging from Harry Potter to Quantum Physics, Assassin's Creed to Game of Thrones and so much more. J.K.Rowling, Bill Gates, Albert Einstein, Dennis Ritchie, Linus Torvalds, Steve Jobs, George R.R. Martin, Martin Goodman, Walt Disney, Schrodinger, the list of successful and renowned geeks is endless. And what do they all have in common? They are(or unfortunately were) passionate. What they are passionate about differs, but they are none-the-less.</p>
          <p>Having dissected the meaning of the word 'geek' on a molecular level, let's now look at what a geek is not. A geek is stereotypically thought to be a programmer, someone who spends hours behind a computer typing away multitudes lines of code and generally bespectacled. Well, in reality the word 'geek' is actually a superset. It consists of people keen about technology, gadgets and softwares but is not limited to them. There are people who are amateurs when it comes to tech but are still considered geeks. Some people also live under the misconception that all geeks are extremely studious and books are their lives. If you are one of those people, it's a sincere request to shun that thought away. The correct word for that would be a 'nerd'. Once again, a nerd is a geek but a geek might or might not be a nerd. To understand the difference between the two consider this, a geek might say, 'May the force be with you' while a nerd will say, 'May the force be mass times the acceleration.' Get it? (If you don't, as soon as you finish reading this, watch Star Wars!) A nerd loves the Leibniz Integral Rule while a geek loves Tony Stark. </p>
          <p>Another thing which is hard-wired into some people's thought process,to our dismay, is that all geeks are socially inept. A huge misunderstanding. Yes, some of us are introverts but not all. Others are just as curious about meeting people as we are about the next Avengers sequel. Meeting people who share the same interests as ours thrills us and the eight hour long conversations that ensues on how cunning Littlefinger is or whether Snape is a tragic hero or not are equally exciting.</p>
          <p>We are part of fandoms and we are proud of them. Art, Literature, Sports, Technology, Science, Fiction, Non-Fiction even Music more metal than the left side of the periodic table, if there is enough depth to the subject and if we are interested, you'll see us obsessing over it like a child obsesses over candy. Our vocabulary fails us when someone asks us to describe how we feel about the things we love, exuberant being one of them. There is one word though which we feel is apt for us, 'geek'. </p>
