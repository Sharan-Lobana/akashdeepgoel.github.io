                    The program covers all the basic courses in pure mathematics, along with courses in Applied mathematics that include Fluid dynamics, Operations research, Theory of Elasticity, Graph theory etc. A new, more mathematically oriented syllabus was put in place, beginning 2013. Students may also opt for an exchange program with many universities for a semester. 
                    Undergraduate research in the department is being propelled forward by students and professors alike. Students are given ample opportunities to participate in workshops, summer research internships, winter schools, etc. A CGPA of above 6 merits the INSPIRE scholarship, where the student receives 60,000 Rs per annum to aid their scientific pursuits.
                    Several software companies and consultancy services like Goldman Sachs, Oracle, Microsoft and Royal Bank of Scotland that open for Computer Science recruit students from IMSc as well every year. Students also choose careers off the beaten track, such as in Teach for India and some have capitalized on their entrepreneurial streak to open interesting startups.

                <div class="panel-body">My experience at IIT Roorkee has diversified my outlook at different levels. The stream entails all the aspects of life sciences, but frankly it just summarizes them. You will be 'taught' almost everything in the syllabus, but it does not guarantee that you 'know' it or have 'learnt' it. Getting into the depth of these aspects will be your own call, and no one will tell you the best way to get marks. It is not just all biology and chemistry; a part of biotech B.Tech syllabus is similar to chemical engineering courses too. However, it may also happen that you just might not feel the need to connect with the excessive biology or mathematics in it. In such a case, you can work on honing your extracurriculars and the college offers a lot of these eg: fests, NSS/NCC/NSO, cultural groups, startups etc. And even otherwise, you make most of your friends here and learn a lot about how to organize activities in the campus via the institutional setup. 
                As a first year student, I was not knowing about my interests, and I ended up being a part of 5 extracurricular groups per semester, until I realized my capacity to multitask became a limitation in producing effective results. So, just be open to all the possibilities in college and learn to set your priorities right. Internship wise, an average student can easily get a great research project in universities of repute. As a matter of fact, a lot of my friends have worked on Parkinson's' disease, cancer therapy and genetic engineering labs in India and abroad during their internship! As for scope, if you really end up loving life sciences, you can plan to study until PhD from a reputed university after which you can work as a post doctoral researcher at labs in organizations. After 2-3 real good researcher positions, you might become a group leader, principal investigator or an assistant professor, which have a well-settled life but limited increments in income. You get promoted here too, but it is a different ladder altogether. If this scenario scares you, then maybe you won't stick with the stream long enough. So do not confuse 'research' with 'package'. If you wish to optimize the combination of both, then industry recruits Post Docs as research scientists too. Ultimately, it is your interest that matters so don't go by what you have been told, as your experience after 4 years will be different from mine.</div>

                <div class="panel-body">The department offers a mix of core (compulsory) courses and electives. Contrary to popular belief, courses in chemical engineering have little in common with chemistry. A good math base is helpful as several courses are mathematical in nature. Courses cover a wide range of areas like fluid dynamics, petrochemicals and transport phenomenon. Most semesters have at least one practical course, and almost all courses have relative grading. The academic load is not too heavy, some semesters being more rigorous than others, but very manageable. In terms of research, there is scope for research in several areas of chemical engineering – biochemical engineering, pollution abatement, catalysis, petrochemicals, and fluid dynamics. There are several opportunities for undergraduate students to work in labs under the guidance of professors to do small projects to get a glimpse into what research is like. There are students who have done so and even successfully published research papers in international journals however the number of undergraduate students who take an interest in research remains low. Several students choose to pursue further studies in the field and secure admission to MS or PhD programs in reputed universities abroad. 
                Core companies that recruit from chemical engineering include ITC, KBR, Reliance, SRF etc. Apart from these there are several non-core companies that open for all branches where students may choose to apply. </div>

The best part is that many of new faculties are young who not only provide you academic guidance but are also off-class guardians. It offers opportunities for development beyond the classroom which include societies like CEC, internships abroad, international exchanges, a chance to work on challenging projects, participation in new research.

A fresher is first equipped with the core capabilities fundamental to CS, such as data structures and algorithms, discrete mathematics, networks and graph theory, and later given the choice to specialize into one of the research branches.
                The department has ties with IBM Research Labs, Adobe Research and Cisco, helping students take up projects in collaboration with the players in the industry. The focus of research is to push the state-of-the-art forward in the fields of data mining, machine learning, computer networks, natural language processing and social media analytics.

Electrical engineering department at IIT R is one of the oldest of its kind in India. It is also one of the most important departments on campus and is involved in big budget government projects such as Virtual Lab. It has some of the finest professors, most of them being alum of this very department. With a second highest undergrad intake you can be rest assured that there will be enough competition among students in academics as well as co-curricular activities. Electrical Engineering students have made their mark everywhere from sports to campus politics to annual placements. With an average placement package of around 8 lacs per annum and students getting placed in biggies like Goldman Sachs and ITC one can be rest assured of landing a decent job once he joins the Electrical Engineering department. Even on the research front the department is slowly gaining momentum with some quality research work being done under some of the senior most professors. Conferences like CERA 2013 and NPEA 2010 were come of the biggest held in the country and were well attended by students and professors of Indian as well as international universities. </div>

Labs in department are improving for all the fields and significant research work is accomplished in these labs. 
                    Our department has the reputation of having some of the most difficult courses and most strict teachers. While this is correct to a certain extent, things are rapidly changing. You will observe a wave of change in the department as many teachers are trying to increase flexibility and inter-department interaction. There is an overall effort to discard the archaic methods. 
                    The good news is that we are not limited to academics, you will find students from our department in key position in almost all cultural societies, hobbies club and tech. festivals. So, the only advice we can give you is that work extremely hard and enjoy your next four years at the same time. There should never be a time when you don’t have anything to do. 
                    If you are a part of IITR E&CE Dept. you can always consult Anand Bulusu, Vinod Pankajakshan, N.P. Pathak, Kartikeyan Sir for any type of guidance at any point of time. Some professors might sound rude but they are in fact very welcoming and accommodating when you visit them for guidance. We would just say that you need not fear from any professors and better talk to them as and when required. Discuss things with them and take up projects from your area of interest. Especially those who want to pursue electronics, projects are must. We guess, this should be enough. 
                    In terms of placements, Electronics and communication department has one of the best placement stats in the campus, next only to CS. Some of our top recruiters are Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, Qualcomm and Broadcomm. Non-core companies like Facebook, Directi, Goldman Sachs, Flipkart, Schlumberger and ITC also provide opportunities. The average package of the batch graduating in 2014 was estimated to be around 10 lpa. While many students sat in the placements, many others joined IIMs, some cracked the prestigious UPSC exams and some went for other Postgraduate programs.</div>

There are Scholarship Programmes sponsored by esteemed foreign and national institutes, which facilitate and promote the culture of scientific research in the field. Many students from the department have benefitted from such programs like SRFP(by IASc), DAAD, CHARPAK etc. Besides, the students of final year who are supposed to carry out dissertation and thesis work, are awarded a monthly scholarship of Rs. 8000 funded by the MHRD. There are regular guest lectures from visiting guest faculties from the E&P industry or from acknowledged institutes like NGRI, WIHG etc. There is an active student chapter of the international body i.e. SEG (Society of Exploration Geophysicists), at the department, which is known to conduct regular events and guest lectures as mentioned above. 
                    In terms of placements, the core companies pertaining to the course are from the Oil or Mineral Industry such as Shell, Schlumberger, Cairn India etc. to name a few. These companies are known for their high pay scale and work ethics. The students of the department have also been placed in various non-core esteemed companies (software and finance firms) like RBS, Cognizant, Mu Sigma etc. 
                    The years to come are looked upon with high hopes as far as placements, reason being the inflow of a large number of core   companies in the country for exploration purposes, owing to much improved and liberalised government policies.</div>

It possesses a knowledgeable faculty and is expected to become self-sufficient in most facilities (Scanning Electron Microscopy, TEM, TMS, etc) by the the end of 2014. The placements are satisfactory but incapable of satiating ambitious expectations in general. 
                    The most memorable part of my time at the department was the awesome and diverse peer group that I came across. Students, apart from excelling in academics showed great in interest in the field of research pertaining to materials engineering. There is an active participation in sports and other cultural groups. Perhaps the most significant factor that separated us from other branches was the amazing party culture, popularly known as "Meta Chapo". 
                    Personally, I've had so much fun, that it is difficult to put into words. The most important thing a fresher must realize is that time is of great value and should be put to more constructive uses than sending Farmville and Candy Crush requests. One could occupy himself with research projects that not only enrich your knowledge of the subject but give you a great opportunity to interact with a very experienced faculty. Non-core endeavours can also be pursued if they interest you and are a great way for you to develop your confidence and overall personality.</div>

In industry, P&I engineers deal with integrated design and efficient planning of the entire manufacturing system. They are the people in charge of the different processes which require transforming raw materials into manufactured products. 
                    The topics covered in this discipline radically transform the thought process of the students and are applicable everywhere, irrespective of the line of work. The curriculum is not tiresome and gives the students ample time to work on themselves and their projects. Moreover, students are taught in detail the relatively new concepts such as Lean Management, Six-sigma, TQM etc. which are used in industries globally.
                    As far as the scope of this discipline in is concerned, it is limitless. One can choose a career in operations, manufacturing, design, R&D etc. For those who have MBA as an option later in their career, P&I could prove to be extremely useful.
                    The placements in IITR, however, are not extraordinary (with exceptions). For someone looking for an overnight jackpot, this may disappoint you. Other than that, P&I students are at par with their mechanical and chemical counterparts in terms of the number of openings and the packages offered. 
                    For those who wish to pursue a core-oriented career, the placement opportunities in IITR are few and not lucrative enough at the moment. However, that is changing and with time it will improve. Research opportunities in this field are aplenty and there is tremendous scope for the same with studies being conducted amongst the best institutions across the globe.</div>

The Physics Department is a warm place with (mostly) welcoming professors and staff, amids't a backdrop of intellectual stimulation. The academics of the Physics curriculum is quite rigorous, though there is some amount of repetition in courses, but for a general physics enthusiast, the courses are well structured and should give you a rather good insight into the field. With a little effort and interest, it will be a pleasant experience exploring the very depths of perceived reality. 
                    Professors here are involved in frontier research in the areas of string theory, theoretical high energy physics, quantum optics, fiber optics and lasers, nuclear physics and astrophysics, nano-materials and condensed matter. The department houses some excellent laboratories working in quantum optics, low temperature superconductivity, functional materials and lasers. As a student, being excited about physics and somewhat forthcoming, you should be able to engage yourself in some quality research with the professors (or even alone), which would be a rather illuminating experience. There is more focus on experimental physics – but hey, theoreticians just need a pencil and paper, right? An important aspect in the research perspective is the research positions you would take up in the summer – internships in some of the best research institutes in India and abroad, something which would enrich you multifold. Many of us visit renonwed places in India, Germany, US, Australia etc. and do some excellent publishable work. These include, but not limited to IISc. Bangalore, BARC, PRL, TIFR, IUCAA, SINP, IIT's etc. Abroad we target CERN, Max Planck Institutes in Germany, Wisconsin, Georgetown in US amongs't others. Self motivation would really come in handy while purshing research. Patience is needed to excel and slightly more patience is needed to do so in Roorkee.</div>
